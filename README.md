## Setting up your App 

### Registering Your App
Visit the [Pinterest Developer Site](https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/) and register your application. This will generate an appId for you which you will need in the next steps.

### Configuring PDKClient
Before you make any calls using the PDKClient in your app, you will need to configure it with your appId: 

Add the following lines in "onCreate" method of your Launch Activity

```java
//imports
import com.pinterest.android.pdk.PDKCallback;
import com.pinterest.android.pdk.PDKClient;
import com.pinterest.android.pdk.PDKException;
import com.pinterest.android.pdk.PDKResponse;


//inside onCreate
PDKClient.configureInstance(this, YOUR_APP_ID);
PDKClient.getInstance().onConnect(this);
```

Add the following line outside the application tag in the manifest file.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

And add the following Intent filter to your Login Activity

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="pdk[YOUR_APP_ID]" />
</intent-filter>
```

If your APP ID is 1234, scheme would be "pdk1234"


## Example App

The PDK comes with a Example App. Just clone this repo, add your AppId, and run to get started.
